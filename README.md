# cutil
C library to implement
- data structures like linked-lists, vector arrays, maps
- bitmaps & bitwise operations
- architecture-dependent & hardware features
- byte-order endianness detection, byte-swapping
- structure object members mapping, dynamic processing, endianness auto-converting
- dynamic-length structures, members sizes which are determined by mapping or run-time object member value
