# cutil
C library to implement
- variable arguments
- data structures like linked-lists, vector arrays, maps
- bitmaps & bitwise operations
- cross-platform oriented
- assembler-level optimizations
- architecture-dependent & hardware features
- byte-order endianness detection, byte-swapping
- dynamic memory allocator & internal heap management integrated
- structure object members mapping, dynamic processing, endianness auto-converting
- dynamic-length structures, members sizes which are determined by mapping or run-time object member value
- string processing, independent implementations of sscanf (cu_sscanf) and sprintf (cu_sprintf)
- text converting multi-byte (UTF-8) character set to double-byte character set and vise-versa
